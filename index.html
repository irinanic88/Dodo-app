                <p class="ticket-description"> I saw you dancing in a crowded room
                    You look so happy when I'm not with you
                    But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
                    A single teardrop falling from your eye
                    I don't know why I run away
                    I'll make you cry when I run away
                    You could have asked me why I broke your heart
                    You could've told me that you fell apart
                    But you walked past me like I wasn't there
                    And just pretended like you didn't care
                    I don't know why I run away
                    I'll make you cry when I run away
                    Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
                    Save your tears for another
                    Save your tears for another day
                    Save your tears for another day
                    So I made you think that I would always stay
                    I said some things that I should never say
                    Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
                    And now you won't love me for a second time</p>
