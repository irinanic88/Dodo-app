# Description
## Front-end
This is my pet project to learn, exercise and visualize the skills of front-end programming. First it was made on pure JavaScript classes, then it was all passed to React components using Redux to store information. Jest/Enzyme technologies are used for unit testing. 
### Used technologies
HTML5 ðŸ”¸ CSS3 ðŸ”¸ JavaScript(ES6) ðŸ”¸ React ðŸ”¸ Redux ðŸ”¸ React Routing ðŸ”¸ react-beautiful-dnd ðŸ”¸ Jest/Enzyme
## Backend
The backend part was made by @dmitrii606 who also kindly mentored me in this project. 
# How it works
[Here]( https://dodo-app.net/) you can play around with the board, create tickets, change their status and also delete them.
### Few tips to get started:
1.	If you visit Dodo-app for the first time, click Create button, that will provide you a unique ID for your board and also displays you the link to pass directly to your new Board page.

2.	Please, write down your Board ID to be able to open your board after exit it. You can use Routing to navigate. Or you can access then to your board from the main page:

3.	Once you are in your Board page, press Create button to make a new ticket. You can choose its status while creating or editing it, or you can just drag it to a corresponding column. 
4.	Click the ticket on the column to see its description or delete it. 
5.	Thatâ€™s it. Have fun, and donâ€™t stop yourself of being creative on tickets you make.
# Few more words
Being my first personal project, Dodo-app taught me to work independently, to searchâ€¦no â€“ to dig for information and explore and apply new technologies on the move, to get used to devtools and debugger, to become friends with Git and respect testing.
